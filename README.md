## What is WWBase
WWBase is a scalability-first, open-source no-code development platform. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars on research and development, you can deploy WWBase in just a few minutes and have a private, controllable, and highly scalable no-code development platform!

## Distinctive Features
### Data Model-Driven

Most form-, table-, or process-driven no-code products create data structures directly in the user interface, such as Airtable, where adding a new column to a table is adding a new field. This approach is user-friendly but limited in functionality and flexibility for more complex scenarios.

WWBase adopts the design principle of separating the data structure from the user interface. This allows you to create any number of blocks (data views) for data collections, each with different types, styles, content, and actions. This design balances the simplicity of no-code operation with the flexibility of native development.

### What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)

WWBase enables the development of complex and distinctive business systems without requiring specialized operations. With a single click, configuration options appear on the interface, allowing administrators with system configuration privileges to directly configure the user interface in a WYSIWYG manner.

### Everything is Implemented as Plugins

WWBase uses a plugin architecture, meaning all new features can be developed and installed as plugins. Expanding functionality is as easy as installing an app on your phone.
